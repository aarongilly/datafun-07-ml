## Purpose
Completing module 7 in my study at Northwest Missouri State University, course 44608.

## Project Log
What I did to make this project:

- Created a new repository directly in GitHub
  - .gitignore template = python
  - license = MIT
  - added README.md
- In VS Code, cloned the repository to my machine
- Added `requirements.txt` with a suggested set of requirements
- Ran the .venv commands in my zsh terminal:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip  
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

- Updated the README up to this point here -> .
